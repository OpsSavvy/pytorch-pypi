## Usage

### Installation

As a [Nexus Repository](https://help.sonatype.com/en/sonatype-nexus-repository.html) admin, configure a [new PyPI proxy](https://help.sonatype.com/en/pypi-repositories.html#proxying-pypi-repositories) repository:
- define name: `pypi-pytorch` for example
- define URL for remote storage: `https://sonatype-nexus-community.github.io/pytorch-pypi/whl/`

You can also create compute platform specific proxies if necessary, like `pypi-pytorch-cu129` pointing to `https://sonatype-nexus-community.github.io/pytorch-pypi/whl/cu129/`

For nightly versions, simply create a `pypi-pytorch-nightly` repository pointing to `https://sonatype-nexus-community.github.io/pytorch-pypi/whl/nightly/`

These PyPI proxies can also be added to your `pypi-all` group repository if you created one.

### Access With `pip`

Newly created PyPI proxies can now be used with `pip` using provided `--index-url`, like:

```
pip3 install torch==2.8.0+cu129 --index-url http://localhost:8081/repository/pypi-pytorch/simple
```
or
```
pip3 install torch --index-url http://localhost:8081/repository/pypi-pytorch-cu129/simple
```
for nightly
```
pip3 install torch --index-url http://localhost:8081/repository/pypi-pytorch-nightly/simple

or

pip3 install torch==2.8.0.dev20250613+cu129 http://localhost:8081/repository/pypi-pytorch-nightly/simple
```
